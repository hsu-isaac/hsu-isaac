## About

Hello! My name is Isaac Hsu and I am a software engineer! I had my first exposure to coding relatively recently and have since fallen in love after attending a Web Development Bootcamp called LearningFuze. I hope to be able to create new, useful, and progressively better web applications here! Outside of software development, you can probably find me playing ultimate frisbee or volleyball with my friends.

## Skills

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Postgresql, Material UI, Bootstrap, date-fns, lodash, npm, git
